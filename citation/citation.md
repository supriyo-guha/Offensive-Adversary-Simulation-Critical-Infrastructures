# Citation Guidance

## Primary Academic Reference (Dissertation)
This repository is derived from the author’s M.Tech dissertation, which was **practical and implementation-driven**, including experimental setup, technical analysis, and supporting scripts developed in a controlled academic laboratory environment.

If you are citing the **core experimental work, implementation details, technical procedures, or hands-on results**, please cite the dissertation as the primary academic source.

**Recommended dissertation citation:**

Supriyo Guha.  
*Offensive Simulation on Critical Infrastructure Attacks*.  
M.Tech Dissertation (Software Systems – Security Specialization),  
Department of Computer Science and Information Systems, WILP  
Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani (BITS Pilani),  
India, evaluated December 2025.

## Repository Citation (Research Abstraction and Framework)
This GitHub repository represents an **abstracted and research-facing derivative** of the dissertation. It intentionally focuses on:

- adversary behavior modeling and lifecycle abstraction,
- architectural and trust-boundary analysis,
- Operational Security (OpSec) considerations,
- ethical and methodological framing for academic reuse.

The repository **does not include the original implementation code or scripts** from the dissertation. This separation is intentional and is maintained to support ethical dissemination, academic review, and doctoral-level research use.

If you are citing the **conceptual framework, lifecycle models, architectural abstractions, or research methodology**, this repository may be cited as a **supporting research artifact**.

**Recommended repository citation:**

Supriyo Guha.  
*Offensive Adversary Simulation for Critical Infrastructure Environments*.  
GitHub repository, 2026.

## Relationship Between Dissertation and Repository
The M.Tech dissertation contains the **full practical and technical implementation**, including laboratory experiments and scripts, while this repository provides a **formalized abstraction layer** intended for:

- academic discussion and peer review,
- doctoral research preparation,
- methodological reuse without exposing operational detail,
- long-term research continuity beyond the original implementation.

This repository should be treated as a **conceptual and methodological companion** to the dissertation, not as a substitute for the original experimental work.

---

## Ethical and Research Use
This repository is intended solely for **academic and research purposes**. It excludes exploit code, operational scripts, and deployable tooling by design. Any use of this work must comply with institutional ethics policies, laboratory authorization requirements, and applicable laws.

---

## Future Publications
This repository may later be associated with:
- Doctoral (PhD) research,
- peer-reviewed conference or journal publications,
- extended technical or methodological reports.

Updated citation formats (BibTeX, DOI, or arXiv references) will be added to this directory when applicable.
