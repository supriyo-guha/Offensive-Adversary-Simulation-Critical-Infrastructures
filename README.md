# Offensive Adversary Simulation on Critical Infrastructures

## Abstract
This repository presents an **academic adversary simulation framework** for the ethical study of **offensive cyber operations targeting critical infrastructure environments**. The work emphasizes **adversary behavior modeling, attack lifecycle abstraction, and IT–OT interaction analysis**, rather than exploit development or operational tooling.

This repository is derived from an M.Tech (Cyber Security) dissertation and is structured to support **doctoral (PhD) research** in Red Teaming and Adversary Simulation.

## Research Motivation
The increasing convergence of Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) has expanded the attack surface of critical infrastructure systems. While defensive mechanisms and incident response strategies are widely studied, **controlled offensive simulations that model realistic adversary behavior across segmented IT–OT environments remain limited in academic literature**.

This work frames **offensive simulation as a research methodology**, enabling systematic analysis of trust abuse, attack progression, and cyber–physical risk under clearly defined ethical and institutional constraints.

## Repository Organization
The repository is organized into research-focused components:

- `research-notes/` — literature review and research gap analysis  
- `lab-infra-designs/` — system architecture and segmentation rationale  
- `attack-lifecycle/` — adversary behavior and lifecycle modeling  
- `opsec/` — operational security as a research variable  
- `mappings/` — alignment with MITRE ATT&CK and ATT&CK for ICS  
- `docs/` — threat model, ethics, research questions, and usage guidance  
- `citation/` — citation metadata for academic reuse  

---

## Intended Audience
This repository is intended for:
- PhD supervisors and research committees
- Doctoral and postgraduate researchers
- Cybersecurity researchers studying adversary behavior
- Defensive practitioners seeking attacker-centric insights

It is **not intended for operational offensive use**.

## Citation
The original *M.Tech* dissertation contains full practical implementations, including experimental setup and technical scripts. This repository presents an **abstracted research framework** derived from that work, intentionally excluding operational code to support ethical academic dissemination and Doctoral-level research.

If this repository contributes to academic work (such as a thesis, dissertation, conference paper, or journal article), please refer to the citation guidance provided under the `citation/` directory.
