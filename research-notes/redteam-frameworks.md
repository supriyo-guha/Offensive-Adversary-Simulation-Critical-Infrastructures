# Red Teaming Frameworks and Methodologies

## Introduction
Red Teaming has evolved from ad hoc penetration testing into a discipline emphasizing adversary emulation, strategic objectives, and behavioral realism.

This document reviews key frameworks relevant to academic adversary simulation research.

---

## MITRE ATT&CK
MITRE ATT&CK provides a comprehensive anatomy of adversary behaviors across enterprise environments.

### Strengths
- Behavior-centric structure
- Community validation
- Applicability across sectors

### Limitations
- Primarily descriptive rather than prescriptive
- Limited guidance on lifecycle sequencing

---

## MITRE ATT&CK for ICS
ATT&CK for ICS extends enterprise modeling into industrial domains.

### Strengths
- Domain-specific focus
- Emphasis on operational impact

### Limitations
- Less mature than enterprise ATT&CK
- Limited real-world validation

---

## Cyber Kill Chain Models
Kill Chain models emphasize sequential attack phases.

### Strengths
- Clear progression logic
- Useful for high-level reasoning

### Limitations
- Linear assumptions
- Limited adaptability modeling

---

## Enterprise Domain Intrusion Models
Research on Active Directory exploitation highlights identity systems as critical adversary enablers.

These models strongly influence the adversary lifecycle used in this repository.

---

## Research Implications
No single framework fully captures adversary behavior in IT–OT contexts. This work synthesizes elements from multiple frameworks to support **academic adversary simulation**.

---

## Conclusion
Red Team frameworks provide essential structure but require adaptation for research use. This repository applies these frameworks at the behavioral abstraction level.
