# Gaps in Existing Research

## Introduction
Despite extensive research in cybersecurity and ICS protection, significant gaps remain in the academic study of offensive adversary simulation.

This document summarizes gaps identified through literature review and case study analysis.

---

## Identified Research Gaps

### Gap 1: IT–OT Adversary Integration
Most studies treat IT and OT security as separate domains, despite
evidence that real-world attacks traverse both.

---

### Gap 2: Repeatable Offensive Methodologies
Offensive research often focuses on tooling or isolated techniques, lacking structured, reusable methodologies.

---

### Gap 3: Operational Security as a Research Variable
Adversary OpSec is frequently acknowledged but rarely modeled or analyzed systematically.

---

### Gap 4: Ethical Offensive Simulation
Academic hesitation around offensive research has led to over-sanitized models that fail to capture realistic behavior.

---

### Gap 5: Cyber–Physical Impact Abstraction
There is limited guidance on how to study cyber–physical impact without introducing safety or ethical risks.

---

## Positioning of This Work
This repository addresses these gaps by:

- integrating IT and OT adversary models,
- emphasizing methodology over tooling,
- treating OpSec as an analytical dimension,
- and defining clear ethical boundaries.

---

## Conclusion
Identifying and addressing these gaps is essential for advancing critical infrastructure security research. This work contributes a structured foundation for future doctoral study.
