# Domain Fronting as an OpSec Phenomenon (Research Perspective)

## 1. Research Motivation
Domain fronting has historically been used to obscure the true endpoint of network communications by leveraging trusted infrastructure. In this repository, domain fronting is examined **only at a conceptual level**.

The goal is to understand how adversaries exploit **trust asymmetry** between infrastructure providers, defenders, and network policy.

---

## 2. Trust Asymmetry
Domain fronting exploits situations where:
- trust is extended to infrastructure intermediaries,
- inspection capabilities are limited or deferred,
- and policy enforcement relies on assumed legitimacy.

From a research perspective, this highlights the importance of modeling **implicit trust** in adversary simulation.

---

## 3. Behavioral Implications
Adversaries employing such strategies must balance:
- increased stealth,
- dependency on third-party infrastructure,
- and reduced control over availability.

These trade-offs influence strategic decision-making and risk tolerance.

---

## 4. Constraints and Evolution
Modern infrastructure providers have reduced the feasibility of domain fronting. This evolution itself is a valuable research insight, showing how adversary techniques adapt to policy and ecosystem changes.

---

## 5. Research Relevance
Even when not practically viable, domain fronting remains relevant as:
- an example of trust abuse,
- a case study in infrastructure-mediated OpSec,
- and a conceptual model for future adaptation strategies.

---

## 6. Ethical Boundary
No guidance on implementation or circumvention is provided. Domain fronting is discussed solely to support **theoretical understanding of OpSec behavior**.
