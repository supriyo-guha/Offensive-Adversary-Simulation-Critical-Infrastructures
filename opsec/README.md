## Operational Security (OpSec) Influence

The following figure illustrates the role of operational security (OpSec) as a **decision-influencing construct** across the adversary lifecycle. Rather than being treated as a binary attribute, OpSec is modeled as a **continuous trade-off space** shaped by detection pressure, communication exposure, and persistence objectives.

This abstraction emphasizes how adversary behavior is constrained by risk management considerations, particularly in segmented and high-sensitivity environments such as critical infrastructure.

## OpSec Trade-off Analysis

The following conceptual graph represents the relationship between **operational aggressiveness (or visibility)** and **detection risk** in adversary behavior. The graph is intended to support analytical
reasoning about OpSec decision-making and strategic trade-offs, rather than to depict empirical measurements or quantitative evaluation.

The model highlights how increased operational tempo and visibility tend to elevate detection risk, while conservative and low-noise behavior favors stealth and persistence.
