# Research Questions Addressed

## Overview
This repository is structured around a set of **explicit research questions**
that guide the study of **adversary behavior and offensive simulation as an
academic research methodology** for critical infrastructure environments.
The questions emphasize **systemic behavior, trust relationships, and risk
abstraction**, rather than exploit development or operational attack execution.

---

## Primary Research Question

**RQ0: How can adversary simulation be structured as a repeatable, ethically
sound academic methodology for studying security properties of critical
infrastructure systems?**

This primary question frames adversary simulation as a **research instrument**
for analyzing system behavior under adversarial pressure, rather than as an
operational offensive capability.

---

## Secondary Research Questions

### RQ1: IT–OT Interaction
How do architectural dependencies and trust relationships between enterprise
IT systems and operational technology (OT) environments influence adversary
movement and the feasibility of cross-domain progression?

---

### RQ2: Enterprise Identity and Trust
What role do enterprise identity systems, domain trust relationships, and
access mediation mechanisms play in enabling adversary persistence and lateral
movement within segmented environments?

---

### RQ3: Operational Security as a Research Variable
How does adversary operational security (OpSec) influence the realism,
persistence, and detectability of simulated adversary lifecycles in controlled
research environments?

---

### RQ4: Constrained Adversary Decision-Making
How do realistic security controls—such as segmentation, access control, and
monitoring—shape adversary decision-making and attack progression when
exploit-centric assumptions are removed?

---

### RQ5: Cyber–Physical Risk Abstraction
How can potential cyber–physical impact in critical infrastructure
environments be **conceptually modeled and reasoned about** without engaging
in destructive, unsafe, or irreversible experimentation?

---

## Research Contribution Framing
Rather than producing a single empirical outcome, this research contributes:

- a structured methodology for adversary simulation in academic settings,
- reusable abstractions for modeling attacker behavior and system trust,
- and a foundation for future detection-aware and policy-relevant security
  studies.

These questions collectively inform the repository’s architecture,
documentation structure, and analytical scope, and are intended to evolve as
part of doctoral research.
