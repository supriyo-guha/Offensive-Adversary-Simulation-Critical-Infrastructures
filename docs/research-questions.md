# Research Questions Addressed

## Overview
This repository is structured around a set of **explicit research questions** intended to guide inquiry into offensive adversary simulation for critical infrastructure environments. These questions emphasize **methodology, behavior, and systemic risk**, rather than technical exploitation.

---

## Primary Research Question
**How can offensive adversary simulation be structured as a repeatable and ethically sound academic methodology for studying critical infrastructure security?**

This question frames offensive activity as a **research instrument**, not an operational capability.

---

## Secondary Research Questions

### RQ1: IT–OT Interaction
How do architectural and trust relationships between enterprise IT systems and operational technology environments influence adversary movement and feasibility of cross-domain access?

---

### RQ2: Enterprise Domain Intrusion
What role do enterprise identity systems and domain-level trust play in enabling adversary persistence and lateral movement within segmented environments?

---

### RQ3: Operational Security as a Variable
How does adversary operational security (OpSec) affect the realism, longevity, and detectability of simulated attack lifecycles?

---

### RQ4: Constrained Adversary Behavior
How do realistic security controls (segmentation, access mediation, logging) shape adversary decision-making and attack progression?

---

### RQ5: Cyber–Physical Risk Modeling
How can potential cyber–physical impact be **conceptually modeled** without engaging in destructive or unsafe experimentation?

---

## Research Contribution Framing
Rather than producing a single empirical result, this work contributes:

- a structured adversary simulation methodology,
- a set of reusable abstractions,
- and a framework for future detection-aware studies.

These questions collectively guide the repository’s architecture, documentation, and analytical scope.
