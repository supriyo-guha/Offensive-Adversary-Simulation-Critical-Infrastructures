# How to Use This Repository (for Researchers)

## Intended Use
This repository is intended to be used as a **research reference and conceptual framework** for studying adversary behavior in critical infrastructure environments. It is not designed as a training ground for operational offensive activities.

---

## Recommended Reading Order
Researchers are encouraged to follow this sequence:

1. Threat model and ethics documentation
2. Research questions and literature notes
3. System architecture and trust boundaries
4. Adversary lifecycle and OpSec analysis
5. Framework mappings and future extensions

This order reflects the logical flow of an academic study.

---

## Research Applications
This repository may be used to:

- Support doctoral research
- Inform coursework on adversary simulation
- Develop detection-aware threat models
- Compare architectural security assumptions
- Frame Red-Team / Blue-Team Co-evolution studies

---

## Reproducibility Considerations
This repository does not aim to provide a fully reproducible technical lab. Instead, it provides **methodological reproducibility**, enabling researchers to:

- adapt models to their own controlled environments,
- test alternative threat assumptions,
- extend the lifecycle to defensive evaluation.

---

## Extending the Work
Researchers may extend this repository by:

- introducing alternative adversary profiles,
- modifying segmentation assumptions,
- integrating defensive telemetry analysis,
- applying the methodology to other critical sectors.

Any extension should clearly state new assumptions and ethical constraints.

## Academic Attribution
If this repository informs academic work, researchers are encouraged to cite it and acknowledge its research context. Proper attribution supports responsible knowledge sharing and scholarly continuity.
