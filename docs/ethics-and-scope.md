# Ethics and Scope

## Ethical Foundations
This repository adheres to **academic research ethics** governing cybersecurity and critical infrastructure studies. Offensive simulation is treated as a means to **understand and mitigate risk**, not to enable harm.

The work aligns with principles commonly required by institutional ethics committees, including:
- necessity,
- proportionality,
- containment,
- and non-attribution.

---

## Authorized Research Context
All simulations described or implied in this repository are assumed to occur within:
- isolated laboratory environments,
- institutionally authorized systems,
- non-production infrastructure.

No real organizations, systems, or data are involved.

---

## Scope Definition
The scope of this research includes:

- Adversary behavior abstraction
- System architecture analysis
- Attack lifecycle modeling
- Operational security considerations
- Conceptual cyber–physical impact analysis

The scope explicitly excludes operational deployment.

---

## Explicitly Excluded Activities
The following are not part of this work:

- Development or release of weaponized malware
- Live command-and-control infrastructure
- Step-by-step exploitation instructions
- Real-world reconnaissance or targeting
- Destructive manipulation of industrial processes

---

## Risk Mitigation Measures
To reduce misuse risk:
- Technical details are abstracted
- Configurations and commands are omitted
- Focus is placed on *why* behaviors occur, not *how* to execute them

---

## Responsible Use Statement
Researchers using or extending this work are expected to:
- obtain appropriate approvals,
- operate within legal and ethical frameworks,
- clearly document deviations from stated assumptions.

This repository is intended to **advance defensive understanding through controlled offensive reasoning**.
