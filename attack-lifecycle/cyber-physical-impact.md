# Cyber–Physical Impact Modeling

## 1. Conceptual Framing
Cyber–physical impact is modeled as **risk realization**, not execution. The research focuses on how cyber access translates into potential physical or operational consequences.

---

## 2. Impact Without Destruction
The model explicitly recognizes that:
- operational disruption may occur without physical damage,
- organizational decisions often determine impact severity,
- uncertainty and degraded confidence can be impactful outcomes.

This reflects incidents such as Colonial Pipeline and AIIMS Delhi.

## 3. Layers of Impact
Impact is modeled across multiple layers:
- Technical: loss of visibility or control
- Operational: service disruption or degradation
- Organizational: shutdown decisions, recovery effort
- Societal: public trust and safety implications

---

## 4. Research Variables
Key variables include:
- duration of access,
- scope of influence,
- timing relative to operations,
- and response decision thresholds.

These variables allow comparative and scenario-based research.

---

## 5. Ethical Safeguards
No destructive actions are described or implied. Cyber–physical impact is treated as an **analytical construct**, suitable for simulation and policy study.

## 6. Contribution to Doctoral Research
This model enables:
- safe study of cyber–physical risk,
- integration of organizational behavior into security research,
- and alignment of adversary simulation with resilience planning.
