# IT-to-OT Pivoting

## 1. Research Motivation
IT-to-OT pivoting represents one of the most consequential transitions in critical infrastructure attacks. This transition is constrained by design, policy, and operational necessity.

The purpose of modeling this phase is to understand **feasibility under constraints**, not to provide bypass techniques.

---

## 2. Conduit-Centric Movement
The model assumes OT access occurs only through:
- approved conduits,
- mediated access points,
- and legitimate operational workflows.

The adversary is modeled as discovering and abusing these pathways rather than circumventing them.

---

## 3. Behavioral Preconditions
Successful pivoting requires:
- sufficient enterprise privilege,
- awareness of operational dependencies,
- and timing aligned with legitimate activity.

This reinforces the role of persistence and patience.

---

## 4. Decision and Risk Factors
The adversary must evaluate:
- likelihood of detection,
- operational consequences,
- and long-term objectives.

In many cases, observation and positioning may be favored over action.

---

## 5. Research Implications
This model supports analysis of:
- how segmentation policies shape feasibility,
- how operational workflows expose conduits,
- and how organizational decisions amplify or limit impact.

---

## 6. Ethical Constraint
No direct OT manipulation or procedural guidance is provided. Pivoting is modeled purely as a **conceptual state transition**.
