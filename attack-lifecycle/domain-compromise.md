# Domain Compromise

## 1. Research Perspective
Domain compromise is treated as a **qualitative shift in adversary capability**, rather than a technical event. It represents control over identity, policy, and authorization mechanisms.

This framing reflects the reality that domain-level access often functions as a control plane compromise.

## 2. Capability Transformation
Upon domain compromise, the adversary gains:
- visibility into trust relationships,
- ability to influence authorization,
- and persistence across systems.

This transforms the attack from opportunistic to systemic.

---

## 3. Constraints and Trade-Offs
Even with domain-level access, the adversary must consider:
- increased detection risk,
- audit trail expansion,
- and the impact of misuse on operational continuity.

Therefore, control does not imply immediate or unrestricted action.

## 4. Research Questions Enabled
This model supports doctoral inquiry into:
- how much control is necessary to achieve cross-domain movement,
- how identity governance affects adversary persistence,
- and how trust centralization influences systemic risk.

---

## 5. Ethical Boundary
No implementation details or attack techniques are described. Domain compromise is treated as an **abstract state with defined capabilities**.
